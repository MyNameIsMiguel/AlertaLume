# AlertaLume
First big project I made with my classmates. It seems to be a fire warnings aplication



                                                                      ## README ##        

AlertaLume is an application where you can post a fire warning, adding a photo, and see the existing warnings in your area.
This application we did in the second year of FP.
Not everything that appears here is done by me, I only did the php with 2 more people and the HTML & CSS, nothing related to the leafleft library or javascript. 
Unfortunately, the application is not finished, we did not get to complete it and show it before the end of the course.
